2.0.0
-----

This release provides a re-written Laravel Blade syntax for Sublime Text 4137+,
which extends rewritten PHP syntax and makes use of latest syntax engine features.

It resolves issues #191 and #194 by embedding extended JS/CSS syntaxes.

ATTENTION
---------

This release comes with a number of breaking changes
which may require some adjustments for snippets or plugins to continue working!

1. Primary syntax definition is `HTML (Blade)`.

   The name follows a common naming scheme being used for various template syntaxes
   and expresses HTML to be the base syntax being extended by Blade template code.

   This release also ships with `CSS (Blade)` and `JavaScript (Blade)`, which can
   be used to highlight standalone CSS/JS templates, if ever needed.

2. The already existing `text.html.blade` is now the main scope replacing `text.blade`.

   This is also to expresses Blade being based on HTML.

3. Scope names have completely been overhauled/refactored to follow current guidelines
   and to express semantic meaning of certain expressions more accurately.

Please close and re-open all open Blade templates to re-assign new syntax definitions!
